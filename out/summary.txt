The company has a new strategic initiative to increase market penetration, maximise brand loyalty and enhance intangible assets. They require seven red lines drawn, with some using green ink and some with transparent ink, while still keeping them strictly perpendicular. Anderson, the expert in charge of this task, explains that red lines can only be drawn with red ink and that it's impossible to draw a red line with green or transparent ink. However, Anderson suggests drawing two red lines and the rest with transparent ink. The design specialist also asks if Anderson can draw one of the lines in the form of a kitten, which Anderson refuses but later agrees to draw a red balloon that is in the form of a kitten when inflated.
